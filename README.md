## Simple Form Validation

JavaScript provides a way to validate user data entered in a form  before it is sent to a web server. Form validation generally performs two functions.

- Basic Validation − This validation checks whether all the required form fields are filled in.

- Data Format Validation − This validation simply checks whether the data entered for each field is done in the correct form and using appropriate values. Your code must include appropriate logic to test correctness of data.
